## **Project Structure**

- **`Ai_Model.ipynb`**  
  Jupyter Notebook used for training and evaluating the machine learning model. It includes the data preprocessing, model training, and performance evaluation

- **`Concrete Compressive Strength.csv`**  
  Dataset containing information about the components of concrete and their corresponding compressive strength values
  **Dataset link:** [Concrete Compressive Strength Dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/niteshyadav3103/concrete-compressive-strength)

- **`app.py`**  
  Flask API that serves the trained machine learning model, allowing users to send input data and receive predictions

- **`model.pkl`**  
  Serialized (saved) machine learning model, ready for deployment and use in the API

  - **`Concrete Compressive Strength.pptx`**  
  A PowerPoint presentation summarizing the project

- **`Ai project proposal.pdf`**  
  A document outlining the project proposal

- **`requirements.txt`**  
  File containing the list of Python dependencies needed to run the project
