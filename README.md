# **Concrete Compressive Strength Prediction**

This project predicts the compressive strength of concrete based on its components using a machine learning model. The application is designed to provide accurate and efficient predictions through an API.

## **Project Structure**

- **`Ai_Model.ipynb`**  
  Jupyter Notebook used for training and evaluating the machine learning model. It includes the data preprocessing, model training, and performance evaluation.

- **`Concrete Compressive Strength.csv`**  
  Dataset containing information about the components of concrete and their corresponding compressive strength values.

- **`app.py`**  
  Flask API that serves the trained machine learning model, allowing users to send input data and receive predictions.

- **`model.pkl`**  
  Serialized (saved) machine learning model, ready for deployment and use in the API.

- **`requirements.txt`**  
  File containing the list of Python dependencies needed to run the project.
